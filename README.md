# 2242 
### (It's a game!)

The purpose of this project is to utilize java's AWT, Swing, and SQL libraries to create a medium-scale application.

AWT handles the events and images, Swing is used for the Frame and DrawPanel, and SQLite will be used to store information between saves (as well as some miscellaneous information).

The game's mechanics will take after the arcade game 1942 (and various other scrolling-shooter games). The art-style will be 8 bit.

*This application uses Maven to manage dependencies.
