    Garbage collection of projectiles runs once a frame; This includes out of bounds projectiles. Performance could
be improved by separating OOB projectiles and inactive projectiles. Collection would be performed on the former every
x amount of frames while on the latter every single frame.

    When playerVessel collides, its collide() method is called, but this method does not affect the position of the
playerVessel. Need to write something that updates entities' "colliding" states, as well as a bounce() method.
Although, come to think of it, the bounce() method may take care of everything and render the "colliding" state useless.
Bounce() must somehow override an entity's routine(), read that entity's direction, and "bounce" the entity in the other
direction.

    Must create boundaries for playerVessel and investigate several buggy phenomena:
1. When the frames are attempting to "catch up" (or at least I assume this is the case), the playerVessel can blip
    offscreen.
2. Sometimes (Under the assumption that this also happens when the frames are attempting to "catch up"), playerEntity
    will be rendered unmovable (I forget if the "fire" method is still called when this happens). To allow further
    movement, one must click on the JFrame.
